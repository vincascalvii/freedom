    "html": "<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Not too long after, Cyrus and I stumble upon a local bar, where the lively atmosphere beckons us inside. Seated around a table, along with the fresh new clothes, it feels as if I&rsquo;m fully blended in with the locals here.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Cyrus hands me a cup, and it looks like the content inside is alcoholic. I hesitate a bit; it&#39;s been a while since my last drink, and I&#39;m not sure how quickly it might affect me.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Just one.&rdquo; Cyrus said as if he understood.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Alright.&rdquo; I grabbed the drink.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Sorry for the wait.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Beside us, a man with glasses and slightly long, iris-purple hair takes a seat. Behind those lenses gleams a pair of violet eyes, sharp and crystalline like amethyst, radiating intellect. His attire mirrors Cyrus&rsquo;s&mdash;blue and white garments adorned with elegant golden embroidery, telling a quiet story of nobility and craftsmanship.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;So&hellip; who do we have here?&rdquo; the man asked, his tone smooth and inquisitive.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;This is Vincas,&rdquo; Cyrus said, rising to his feet. &ldquo;Vincas, meet Xenon&mdash;the friend I mentioned earlier.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Nice to meet you, Vincas,&rdquo; Xenon greeted, offering his hand.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Likewise,&rdquo; I replied, standing up to shake it.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Cyrus exhaled, his tone shifting to something more solemn. </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">He pauses, waiting for the right moment. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get started.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">He draws a deeper breath and speaks the words with quiet weight. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s one of us, Xenon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Xenon goes still.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not from this world.&rdquo; Cyrus added, his voice dropping to a whisper.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">A moment passes, and then Xenon&rsquo;s eyes widen in sudden realization. The reaction is instant&mdash;and genuine.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Cyrus glances over and grins. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not the only ones. There are more of us out there. And some more&hellip; might even be on their way. Isn&rsquo;t that exciting?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Yes. That fact alone has already made my day,&rdquo; Xenon said, his eyes still gleaming with intrigue. &ldquo;So, Vincas&mdash;how did you arrive here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Straight to the point, as always, huh?&rdquo; Cyrus teased, raising an eyebrow.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Time won&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo; Xenon replied with a faint smile.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip; not entirely sure,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I just opened my eyes and found myself in this world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;What were you doing before that?&rdquo; Xenon pressed gently.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;I&hellip; can&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Vincas has trouble recalling anything from his previous world,&rdquo; Cyrus interjected. &ldquo;It seems like the teleportation caused some sort of memory loss.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span>&ldquo;Interesting&hellip;&rdquo; Xenon mused, tapping his fingers together. Then he suddenly pauses. &ldquo;Wait&mdash;you said his </span><span class=\"c2\">previous world</span><span>. Why not just say </span><span class=\"c2\">Earth</span><span class=\"c0\">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; Cyrus answered, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s not from Earth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">There is a brief silence before Xenon nods slowly, the wheels already turning behind his eyes. &ldquo;I see. If Valhalla is a separate world from Earth, then it shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising that other worlds exist as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">I take the chance to ask what has been lingering in my mind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been curious&mdash;how did both of you end up here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Xenon was teleported here, just like you. As for me&hellip; I died and was reincarnated into this world. Both of us arrived after our deaths in the old one.&rdquo; Cyrus answered.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Are you able to describe what your other world was like?&rdquo; Xenon asked, curiosity glinting behind his glasses.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">I shake my head. &ldquo;No. Every time I try to think about my previous life, all I see is a blank void&hellip; and then a sharp pain shoots straight through my head.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">The two of them fall silent. For a few moments, they simply watch me&mdash;either trying to understand what I just said, or silently searching for an explanation behind the phenomenon.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;How did things go for you two when you first arrived here?&rdquo; I asked, shifting the topic.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;I had it easy,&rdquo; Cyrus replied, folding his arms with a relaxed smile. &ldquo;I was reincarnated as a child prodigy into one of the five noble houses. Honestly, a lot of things were handed to me on a silver plate. I probably don&rsquo;t have many struggles to share.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Child prodigy&hellip; really?&rdquo; Xenon shot him a flat look.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Self-proclaimed.&rdquo; Cyrus added with a grin.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;I had it a little rougher,&rdquo; Xenon said, ignoring the jab and turning to me. &ldquo;When I woke up, the first thing I saw was a dark room, a fallen stool, and a bundle of torn clothes tied into a noose on the floor.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">This setup&hellip; </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m assuming the previous owner of this body attempted suicide,&rdquo; he continued calmly. &ldquo;Maybe he failed and knocked himself out. Maybe he succeeded, and I just&hellip; took over what was left. Either way, I ended up here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Were you ever able to find out why he did it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span>He nods. &ldquo;He&mdash;now </span><span class=\"c2\">I</span><span class=\"c0\">&mdash;was born into a noble family as well, like Cyrus. It&rsquo;s just speculation, but it seems this body had never resonated with Aetherion. Being a noble and failing to meet expectations must&rsquo;ve driven him to despair. The pressure was too much.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">His voice is detached&mdash;almost like he&rsquo;s recounting someone else&rsquo;s tale. In a way, I suppose he is.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fall for his act,&rdquo; Cyrus cut in, half-chuckling. &ldquo;Since then, he&rsquo;s already managed to resonate with Aetherion and even became a full-fledged Templar of the Fourth Order. He&rsquo;s doing just fine now. No pity necessary.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Oh&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">From what I&rsquo;ve observed so far, it is clear that Cyrus and Xenon are close. There is a looseness to the way Cyrus acts around him&mdash;a familiarity I haven&rsquo;t seen him show with anyone else.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; I said, recalling something that had caught my attention earlier. &ldquo;Cyrus, when we entered through the gate, you showed the guards a kind of medallion. What was that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Oh&hellip; this?&rdquo; Cyrus reached into his coat and pulled it out.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Now that I have a proper look, the medallion is more intricate than I expected. Finely crafted from silver and suspended from a thick chain, it bore the symbol of a towering spire surrounded by rays of light, all enclosed within a perfect circle. There was a sense of symmetry and balance to the design&mdash;simple, yet commanding.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Yes. That,&rdquo; I nodded. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;You can think of it as an identity card&mdash;a very privileged one, in fact,&rdquo; Cyrus replied.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;The medallion proves that he&rsquo;s a Resonated,&rdquo; Xenon added, &ldquo;someone who&rsquo;s received a Soulforge. It&rsquo;s a universally recognized item across the Bastions. With it, a Resonator can freely travel between strongholds.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get one soon too,&rdquo; Cyrus said with a smile.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Wait&mdash;he&rsquo;s joining the Order?&rdquo; Xenon asked, looking at me in surprise, then back at Cyrus. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;ve already roped him in.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Cyrus smirked. &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you dare try to steal him away. First come, first served. Vincas has already agreed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; Xenon turned to me, concern etched into his features. &ldquo;Becoming a Resonator under an Order isn&rsquo;t something to take lightly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there to think about?&rdquo; Cyrus cut in, waving his hand dismissively. &ldquo;Unlike us, he doesn&rsquo;t have a home here yet. If he becomes a Templar&mdash;which, I believe, he certainly can&mdash;he&rsquo;ll be given proper accommodations and income. That alone gives him a foundation to rebuild his life. And on top of that, he gains status&mdash;something vital if he wants to make a place for himself in this world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; Xenon said, frowning. &ldquo;But you left out the part where he&rsquo;ll be fighting Hellspawns the moment he joins the Order. That&rsquo;s not something you can just gloss over. It comes with the risk of death, Cyrus. This isn&rsquo;t a decision to push on someone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Being a Resonator is the most sought-after role in this world,&rdquo; Cyrus argued. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about more than just risk. We protect lives. We carry the will of humanity. We were all given a second chance in this world and especially with gifts like ours, why shouldn&rsquo;t we use them to live fully?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Xenon. I&rsquo;m aware of the risks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Are you sure about this, Vincas?&rdquo; Xenon asked again, his voice tinged with concern. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s just shelter and a way to survive that you&rsquo;re looking for, we have other ways to help you. Becoming a recognised Resonator means taking on a burden. You carry responsibility, and your life could be on the line at any moment.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; I said with calm certainty. &ldquo;I want to join the Order.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">I understand his concern&mdash;really, I do. But if all I want is to survive, I may as well have stayed who I was before. That life&mdash;safe, ordinary, stagnant&mdash;is the very thing I no longer want. I&rsquo;ve been given a second chance in this world, and with it, a gift unlike any other. If I don&rsquo;t take this opportunity, I will only betray that chance and fall back into the same emptiness.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Xenon looks at me for a moment longer, then nods slowly, seemingly satisfied with my resolve.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Maybe I still carry regrets. Maybe I haven&rsquo;t forgiven myself entirely. But what&rsquo;s the use in mourning what&rsquo;s already lost? The only thing that matters now is how I move forward&mdash;with those regrets, not in spite of them.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">In the echoes of my failures, I find the will to redeem myself. For every life I couldn&rsquo;t protect, I&rsquo;ll save twice as many. For every soul I couldn&rsquo;t reach, I&rsquo;ll become a shield for countless others.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Wait&hellip; what am I talking about?</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Why do I want to redeem myself?</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">!!!</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Argh&mdash;&rdquo; A sharp pain stabbed through the back of my head like a hot needle.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; Cyrus and Xenon spoke at once, both instantly on alert.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Yeah&hellip; I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; I said, rubbing the side of my head. &ldquo;Something about my past just&hellip; surfaced out of nowhere.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Xenon exhaled softly, as if letting go of a breath he didn&rsquo;t realise he was holding.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Tomorrow morning, I&rsquo;ll take you to register for the trial,&rdquo; Cyrus said.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Trial? What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trial by combat,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;A basic test to determine whether you&rsquo;ve got the ability to join the Order.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t I have more time to prepare for something like that?&rdquo; I asked, a little anxious.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t need it. I&rsquo;ve seen you fight&mdash;you&rsquo;re more than ready,&rdquo; Cyrus said confidently.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Okay&hellip;&rdquo; I nodded.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;I know you still have a lot of questions,&rdquo; Xenon said gently. &ldquo;So don&rsquo;t hesitate to ask. We&rsquo;re always here to help.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just so much to learn,&rdquo; I admitted. &ldquo;I really appreciate everything&mdash;truly. From both of you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; Cyrus replied with a warm grin. &ldquo;You and Xenon are the only ones I know who came from another world. It&rsquo;s been nearly a decade since I met him. I&rsquo;m honestly glad there&rsquo;s someone else now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Cyrus&rsquo;s words resonate in a way I haven&rsquo;t expected.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Xenon added, his voice calm and sincere. &ldquo;In this estranged world, we&rsquo;re all we&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1 c4\"><span class=\"c0\"></span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">!!!</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Suddenly, a deafening explosion rips through the air outside, shaking the ground beneath us. The walls of the bar tremble, glasses shatter, and for a moment, the warmth of laughter and conversation is replaced by the chilling sound of panicked screams.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Everyone shoots to their feet. Cyrus, Xenon, and I are no exception. We rush outside, instincts guiding our bodies before thought can catch up.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Cyrus is the first to burst through the doors&mdash;and then he freezes.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">His voice comes out low and shaken. &ldquo;How&hellip; in the world&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Xenon and I follow, only to be struck silent by the sight above us.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">There, looming in the sky like some divine punishment, floats a colossal obsidian pillar, impossibly suspended above the heart of the Bastion. Arcs of black lightning crackles around it. A deep hum reverberates through the air, like a heartbeat from another world.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;A Hellsgate?!&rdquo; Cyrus shouted, disbelief etched across his face. &ldquo;Why is it here?!&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;That shouldn&rsquo;t be possible,&rdquo; Xenon added, his voice tight. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no record of one ever appearing within a Bastion. They only show up in the wilds&mdash;or at the borders at worst&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;No time to figure it out.&rdquo; Cyrus&rsquo;s voice snapped back into command. &ldquo;We move. Now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">There is no need for further words. We all nod and sprint forward, the cobblestone streets already erupting in chaos around us&mdash;guards rallying, citizens running, warning horns blaring in rising urgency.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">My heartbeat thunders with every step. The trial I thought I&rsquo;d be facing this morning had just turned into something far greater&mdash;and far deadlier.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Screams echo down the alleys. Fires lick the rooftops. The stench of burning wood mixes with blood and something far fouler&mdash;something not of this world.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Hellspawns swarm the streets&mdash;grotesque, pitch-black creatures that twist and pulse like shadows given flesh. They maul anything in their path. Across the street, one of them tears a man in half with a single swipe.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Cyrus rises into the air, his cape fluttering like a banner of hope against the horror. With a wave of his hand, dozens of glowing ethereal spears materialise around him. Then, he launches them&mdash;each one piercing through the air before impaling the largest Hellspawns in a radiant burst of light and force.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">A desperate cry rises above the chaos.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Help!&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">A woman, pinned beneath a collapsed beam, clutches her crying child tightly. Her leg is twisted at a sickening angle.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Before I can move, a rift tears through space beside her, and from it steps Xenon, his eyes cold with focus. He gently reaches out, pulls them both into the swirling portal, and vanishes&mdash;only to appear moments later across the street, doing the same for another panicked group.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">He moves like a ghost, blinking from one place to the next.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">I clench my hand around a broken stick&mdash;then let my instinct take over. A surge of dark energy well up within me, coating the makeshift weapon in a jagged black sheen.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">No more hesitation. I charge.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">With every swing, the dark-coated weapon proves effective against the Hellspawns. The soldiers, emboldened by our presence, begin to regroup. Side by side, we cut a path through the chaos, pushing the monsters back.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">We secure the plaza. Blood slicks the stone streets, and bodies&mdash;both human and inhuman&mdash;lay still in the aftermath. Fires still burn, but the civilians have mostly escaped. For now, this corner of the Bastion is holding.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; Xenon reappeared beside me, breathing heavily, his coat torn and stained.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay,&rdquo; I panted. &ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m evacuating the rest,&rdquo; he said, eyes scanning the buildings. &ldquo;You follow Cyrus&rsquo;s lead. Tell him I&rsquo;ll be back right away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Got it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">He puts a hand on my shoulder before I leave. His grip is firm&mdash;almost desperate.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to ask for your help so soon, Vincas. I know it&rsquo;s selfish to drag you into this right after everything&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; I interrupted, locking eyes with him. &ldquo;I want to fight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span>For a second, his stern expression softens. Then he </span><span>gives</span><span class=\"c0\">&nbsp;me a nod&mdash;and vanishes once more.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">As I turn to find Cyrus, I can hear distant screams again. More Hellspawns are coming.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">And this time&hellip; they are bigger.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Cyrus then descends beside me, the air around him still crackling faintly with residual energy.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the situation?&rdquo; he asked without wasting a breath.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Xenon&rsquo;s evacuating civilians. He told me to follow your lead&mdash;he&rsquo;ll be back soon.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo; He gave a sharp nod. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re heading straight </span><span>for the Hellsgate</span><span class=\"c0\">. My men should already be converging from the east. We&rsquo;ll be assisting the Third Order.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;The Third Order?&rdquo; I echoed.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the shield of the Bastion. The first responders. If anyone can hold the line while the rest of us arrive, it&rsquo;s them.&rdquo; His voice turned firm. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s move.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">We sprint toward the rising pillar of corruption in the distance, where the skies churn black and red, stained by the presence of the open gate. With every step, the city looks more like a war zone&mdash;collapsed buildings, scorched streets, twisted metal.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Hellspawns swarm the path ahead&mdash;skittering, leaping, shrieking.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">We tear through them. Cyrus leads with terrifying grace, weaving through the battlefield like a storm incarnate. He soars into the air, spears manifesting with each motion of his hands, piercing enemies before they even see him coming. His face is unreadable, eyes locked forward with an unwavering intensity.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">I follow behind, striking fast and true with my darkened weapon. But no matter how many we fell, there are always more. The ground is slick with blood. </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">I watched a family torn apart before I could reach them. A soldier screaming as he was dragged into the shadows. The smell, the sounds&mdash;it claws at my senses, my stomach twisting.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">I force myself to move.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Every scream unanswered. Everybody I failed to save. They burn into my memory. But I keep going. I have to.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Then, ahead of us&mdash;an explosion lights the sky in orange. A wave of flame roars down the avenue, engulfing a swarm of Hellspawns in an instant. The fire dances high into the air like a blazing wall.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">I flinch, instinctively raising my arm to shield myself. But beside me, Cyrus didn&rsquo;t even blink. Instead, his eyes widened&mdash;his expression breaking into something I haven&rsquo;t seen yet tonight: relief.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re here&hellip;&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;The Third Order.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">And then&mdash;through the flame and smoke&mdash;they emerge.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Dozens of silver-armored figures march in perfect formation, their cloaks catching the firelight with a ghostly shimmer. Shields held high, halberds at the ready, they move like a wall&mdash;unyielding, unstoppable. Their steps are thunder. Their presence, divine.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">They push forward with practiced precision, cutting down any Hellspawn in their path. </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">For a moment&mdash;I forgot the chaos. I forgot the death.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">All I could feel was awe.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Hellspawns, one after another, hurl themselves at the soldiers, but the defensive line holds. Their shields resist the onslaught, locking together with practiced precision. Then, a much larger Hellspawn crashes into them, its brute force overwhelming the line. Some soldiers are knocked back, and the beast drops right in front of us.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">But it&rsquo;s already dead&mdash;its body engulfed in flames.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">We don&rsquo;t stop. As soon as the soldiers recognise Cyrus, they instinctively part, letting us through without hesitation.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Ahead of us stands a lone figure&mdash;a woman, poised with a golden staff in hand. A banner of flame coils from its shaft, dancing wildly in the chaos. She moves like flowing fire, weaving through the battlefield with deadly grace. Every Hellspawn that dares approach her is instantly scorched to ash.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Facing her is a massive, stone-like Hellspawn&mdash;its rocky frame resisting her flames with unsettling endurance. Still, the fire continues to grow, intensifying with every second. Despite its hulking build, the creature begins to falter under the heat.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">But then I notice something else.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Is it the fire... or something else entirely? The air around her shimmers strangely, warping like a heat haze. I squint, and faintly&mdash;just barely&mdash;I catch the outline of a shape hidden within the distortion.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">It resembles... a monster.</span></p>"
