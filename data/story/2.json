    "html":"<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">To my mistake, instead of stopping or taking a break, it decides to charge right back to me with a force that looks like it will crush everything in its path.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">I grab firmly on my daggers, and just when the monster is able to hit me, I evade the attack and counter it with a side sweep.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Before I could finish my slash, the monster slams its arm at me and sends me into the air. When I land down, the impact gets me real good.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Normally, I should not be able to move my body from that hit, but thanks to this strange new power that I have just acquired, I&rsquo;m still able to stand back up.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">I can&rsquo;t win this one. I just can&rsquo;t. There is no way in hell I can beat it right now. </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">How about I just run away? I was never meant to take it down from the first place, so why have I even been trying so damn hard for it? But then&hellip; somewhere inside me, I have that burning desire of taking down this monstrous threat on my own.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">The monster opens its third mouth and once again, prepares to do another fire attack.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span>I instinctively </span><span>throw</span><span class=\"c2\">&nbsp;one of my daggers into its mouth, hoping to disrupt its fire-breathing attack. To my surprise, the dagger seems to nullify its fire attack as the smoke comes out instead of the blazing hot flame.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">The monster appears to recoil in pain when its attack backfires, and as it stumbles backwards, I believe this is the moment that I&rsquo;m seeking for.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">If&hellip; I just jump onto it and stab the remaining dagger directly onto its head, perhaps it will die?</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">I don&rsquo;t know whether I can survive it though&hellip; No. There is no more time to think. It&rsquo;s time to act.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">I run straight into it, expecting a hook will come out from either of its arms.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">!!!</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">There it is&mdash;the hook in its last resort to keep me away.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">I jump up, over its arm, and then step onto it, using it as a sturdy ground to leap towards the monster&rsquo;s face. It responds with an ominous growl, opening its large mouth to bite me, but I am not fazed. I use my remaining dagger and dig it deep within its eye.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">The hellspawn writhes and struggles to get the dagger off while I hold onto it for my dear life, trying not to get thrown off it. After god knows how many dizzying spins, I feel that my balance is about to slip away. I have only one more chance to end this.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Just one more second&hellip;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span>Suddenly, the monster starts to slow down. </span><span>It&rsquo;s</span><span class=\"c2\">&nbsp;exhausted! Now is my one opportunity.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">I pour all of my strength to push the dagger deeper down, almost as if the whole handle is burrowed deep into its eye socket. Then, I land a few more punches on its face before finally releasing my grip off the dagger.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">With the remaining of my last strength, I kick off the monster face, causing it to further lose its balance and I watch as its colossal body collapses on the ground hard.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">I fall down, about to lose my consciousness, but before that happens, I make sure to check if the monster is still going to stand back up.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">No sound, no movement. It looks like the monster is finally done for. It&rsquo;s finally over.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">It feels like a small victory, a triumph of the light against the darkness.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">I collapse on the ground, panting and sweating. My heart is still racing with adrenaline. Exhausted, I close my eyes and take a short break, trying to catch my breath.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">I look up at the sky, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Suddenly, high above the chaos, I catch sight of a lone figure suspended in the sky&mdash;floating with an almost divine stillness. Surrounding him are countless objects of light, each shaped like a gleaming spear, radiating with a power I can&#39;t begin to comprehend.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Then, with a single motion, the spears begin to fall&mdash;one by one, raining down upon the battlefield like divine judgment. I can&rsquo;t clearly see the impact through the smoke and distance, but the thunderous crashes and monstrous shrieks make it clear: whatever he unleashed has torn through the enemy ranks.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Wait &hellip; Is it just me or is the sky spinning right now? </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Before I can process it all, my knees buckle. My vision blurs as I collapse onto the ground, consciousness slipping away.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">But just before the world goes dark, I hear them&mdash;footsteps, drawing closer.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">I&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know if these footsteps belong to a friend or foe. Human or monster. But I pray&hellip; they&rsquo;re not the latter.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">&mdash;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">!!!</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c4\">I&rsquo;m&hellip; still alive?</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">My head throbs as I regain consciousness, my body aching with a dull, lingering pain.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Was it the side effect of all the damage I had taken finally catching up to me? Maybe I had been too reckless, too confident in my newfound strength, and pushed my limits too far.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">With a quiet groan, I force myself upright, the stiffness in my muscles making every movement feel sluggish. Blinking away the haze clouding my vision, I take in my surroundings&mdash;a dimly lit space, the scent of herbs and faint traces of dried blood hanging in the air. The fabric walls flutter slightly as a breeze sneaks through the small openings.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c4 c5\">A medical tent&hellip;?</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span>Someone must have found me and brought me here. But who? And more importantly&mdash;where exactly </span><span class=\"c4\">am I</span><span class=\"c2\">?</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;[][][][][] [][][][][]?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">A middle-aged woman, dressed in a worn yet tidy medic&rsquo;s robe, approaches me. Her expression is calm but weary, the kind of exhaustion that comes from tending to the wounded for far too long. She speaks to me in a language I don&rsquo;t understand, her voice gentle yet firm.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">I blink at her in confusion, unsure how to respond. Seeing my reaction, she simply nods, as if understanding my predicament, and walks away to tend to another patient.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">As I take in my surroundings, the grim reality of this place begins to sink in. Rows of injured people lie on makeshift beds, some unconscious, others writhing in pain, their agonized screams filling the air. The scent of blood and medicine mixes in a nauseating blend. Medics hurry from one cot to another, their hands stained red as they desperately try to save lives.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Before I can fully process everything, the entrance of the tent flutters open. A young man steps inside, his appearingly noble-like attire differentiates him from others. He has short, slightly curly chestnut brown hair. His piercing green eyes convey a sense of determination.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Following behind him are several warriors in worn-out armour, whose behaviour tells me that this young man is a highly respected person.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">He barely glances around before locking eyes with me and walking straight in my direction.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;[][][] [][][] [][][] [][][][][][][][][][] [][], [][][][][]?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">As the young man speaks, his words flow past me completely. I shake my head, hoping the gesture conveys my lack of understanding.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">He studies me for a moment, then speaks softly to one of the warriors behind him. The warrior nods and immediately leaves the tent.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">The young man then walks around the tent, speaking to each injured individual.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Not long after, the warrior returns. He reaches into his pocket, pulling out a small, peculiar object and hands over to the young man. </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span>Without a word, the young man </span><span>approaches</span><span class=\"c2\">&nbsp;me again but this time, extending his hand and offering the newly acquired item to me.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">I take it carefully, turning it over between my fingers. The object is made of a smooth, metallic material, its design both intricate and unfamiliar. One end is rounded like a small node, while the other extends into a curving line, spiraling in a near-complete loop.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">He raises a hand, pointing first at the object, then at his ear. His expression is patient but expectant.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Is he telling me to wear it?</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">I hesitate before carefully placing it against my ear, but I must have done it incorrectly because he steps forward, adjusting it with a practiced touch. The device settles snugly against my left ear, resting comfortably in place.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">For a brief moment, nothing happens&mdash;then, a faint hum vibrates against my skin.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;Can you understand me now?&rdquo; The young man spoke.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">The young man&rsquo;s voice is clear, each syllable effortlessly falling into place in my mind.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;What? How&hellip; How am I understanding you?&rdquo; I stammered, my eyes widening in shock. </span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Just moments ago, his words were foreign, incomprehensible. Now, they flow naturally, as if they&rsquo;ve always been part of my language.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Stranger still, I can&rsquo;t recall the exact words he spoke&mdash;only their meaning, as if the language itself has been bypassed entirely, fed directly into my thoughts.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">I glance back at him, searching for an answer, but he only watches me with calm familiarity. It&rsquo;s clear this isn&rsquo;t the first time he&rsquo;s seen someone react like this.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;How can I understand you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">He gestures to my ear, a small smile tugging at his lips. &ldquo;That device you&rsquo;re wearing is called a Whisperbind. It was designed to bind words into whispers, sending their meaning straight into your mind. When you speak, it emits a sound wave that translates your words into something the other person understands.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">A translator&hellip; but not in the way I expected. Instead of simply converting words, it makes language itself irrelevant.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">It feels almost like&hellip; magic.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;Wow&hellip; That&hellip; is amazing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">I never imagined that something could so easily erase the barriers of language. A device like this&mdash;so small, yet so powerful&mdash;must be incredibly valuable.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but this item must be worth a fortune. I can&rsquo;t just take it.&rdquo; </span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">I extend my hand to return it. Before I can place it back in his palm, the young man raises his hand, stopping me.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;No, Whisperbinds are mass-produced,&rdquo; he explained with a casual shrug. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not expensive at all. You can buy them almost anywhere.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">I blink in surprise. &ldquo;I see&hellip; Thanks.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">I brush my fingers against the device resting on my ear. Something so advanced, yet so common? This world continues to throw surprises at me.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;One of my men found you unconscious on the battlefield. Since you were still alive, we brought you back here to recover.&rdquo; His voice is steady, firm&mdash;someone used to giving orders. &ldquo;Now, let me introduce myself properly. My name is Cyrus Lightbearer, and I&rsquo;m a Templar of the Second Order.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">I straighten up slightly, still feeling the weight of exhaustion pressing on my body. </span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;My name is Vincas,&rdquo; I replied, then hesitated. &ldquo;But&hellip; I&rsquo;m sorry, I don&rsquo;t really understand the terms or titles you just used.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Cyrus raises an eyebrow. </span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what a Templar, or an Order is?&rdquo; His tone isn&rsquo;t condescending, but there&rsquo;s a hint of curiosity.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">I shake my head. &ldquo;No. Should I?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Cyrus exhales, rubbing the back of his neck. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; unusual.&rdquo; </span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">He studies me for a moment before continuing. &ldquo;The Orders are our elite forces, dedicated to fighting the Hellspawns.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">I nod in response, while absorbing his words.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">It seems that the battlefield I woke up in, the monsters, the soldiers&mdash;they all point to an ongoing war. I can understand that something must seem off to him. He must be wondering how could I not know something so fundamental?</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Cyrus narrows his eyes, his expression shifting from curiosity to something more calculating. He leans in slightly. &ldquo;Do you know where we are right now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; I replied.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">His gaze lingers on me for a moment before he continues, &ldquo;Everlight, also known as the Dawn Bringers. Ring a bell?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;Everlight?&rdquo; I repeat the name, searching my mind for any recognition. Nothing. I shake my head again. &ldquo;No&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Cyrus exhales through his nose, as if piecing together a puzzle that doesn&rsquo;t quite fit. &ldquo;How did you end up on the battlefield?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite sure,&rdquo; I admitted. &ldquo;I&hellip; woke up, and found myself there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">His brow furrows. </span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;You woke up? In the middle of the battlefield?&rdquo; His voice was tinged with disbelief. &ldquo;Were you sleeping there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;No&hellip; I was definitely sleeping at home&hellip; and then&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Suddenly, a sharp pain lances through my skull, cutting my words short. I clutch my head, gritting my teeth as a wave of dizziness washes over me.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Cyrus watches me closely, then mutters. &ldquo;Were&hellip; you perhaps teleported here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">The pain begins to subside, leaving only a dull ache behind. </span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;Yes&hellip; I believe so.&rdquo; I managed to say.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">His expression hardens. &ldquo;Have you&hellip; ever seen any of those monsters out there before?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">I meet his gaze, feeling the weight of the question. &ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t. This is the first time I&rsquo;ve even heard of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Cyrus observes me carefully. His fingers drum lightly against his forearm, and I can see the gears turning in his mind.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">He turns around to the men behind him, and with a minor gesture, they walk away to give us more privacy. Whatever he&rsquo;s about to discuss with me, seems like a secret that he does not wish others to know.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;Where exactly are you from, Vincas?&rdquo; He broke the silence.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">That&rsquo;s a question I&rsquo;m not sure how to answer.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;Are you from another world?&rdquo; Cyrus continued.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;...&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;As in&hellip; a completely different world.&rdquo; He added.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">I hesitate, the weight of his words settling in my mind.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&rdquo;Another world&hellip; The idea sounds absurd, yet everything I&rsquo;ve seen so far&mdash;the monstrous creatures, the battlefield, the Whisperbind&mdash;none of it belongs to the world I know.&rdquo; I replied.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Cyrus watches me quietly, his expression unreadable. </span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to ask how you can return to your world?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">The question lingers in the air, heavier than I expected.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Return?</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">For a moment, I picture my old life&mdash;the familiar streets, the sky above my home, the warmth of my bed. It feels distant, like a fading dream.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">I look up at Cyrus, uncertainty creeping into my voice. &ldquo;Can I even go back?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;...&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Cyrus remains silent for a moment, as if debating whether to say what&rsquo;s on his mind. After a brief hesitation, he finally speaks.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not alone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I also came from Earth, just like you. But my circumstances were a little different&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t teleported here. I died on Earth and was reincarnated in this world as a newborn.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">His words hit me like a crashing wave. I stare at him, struggling to process what I just heard.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone else I know who&rsquo;s like us,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll introduce you to him when we return to Everlight. He was also brought to this world, so his situation is more like yours. He&rsquo;s been searching for a way back, so maybe you two can&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">I raise a hand, cutting him off.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;I&hellip; want to tell you something first.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Cyrus tilts his head slightly. &ldquo;Sure. Go ahead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">I take a deep breath. &ldquo;I agree that I most likely came from another world. However&hellip; the world I knew was never called Earth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">A flicker of confusion crosses his face before his eyes widen in shock. &ldquo;What? How&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">I can understand his reaction. This whole time, he must have assumed I came from the same world as him&mdash;and perhaps the other person he mentioned. But now, he&rsquo;s not only faced with another world-jumper, but also the realisation that there are even more worlds beyond his own.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">He opens his mouth, hesitating for a moment. I hold my breath, waiting for his response.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Then, his lips curl into a wide grin. &ldquo;That is&hellip; so interesting!&rdquo; His voice brimmed with excitement. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe there&rsquo;s a possibility of more people like us, scattered across different times and spaces.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">I blink. That&rsquo;s&hellip; not the reaction I was expecting. Instead of seeing it as something troubling, he seems genuinely fascinated by the discovery.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;Then&hellip; where are you truly from?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">I part my lips to answer, but before the words can form, a sudden, sharp pain pierces through my skull. My vision waivers for a moment.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Cyrus immediately notices. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; I clutch my head, struggling to push past the searing ache. It feels as if something is actively preventing me from speaking. &ldquo;I&hellip; I can&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo; The realization sinks in, leaving a strange hollowness in my chest. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where I came from.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Cyrus studies me with narrowed eyes, skepticism flickering in his gaze. But after a moment, he exhales and nods, choosing to accept my words.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; he said, his tone softer now. &ldquo;Teleportation must have scrambled some of your memories. It happens. Do you need more rest?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">I shake my head. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo; I steady my breath before meeting his gaze again. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s okay with you&hellip; can you tell me more about this world and about those monsters?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Cyrus rubs his chin in thought, then gives a firm nod.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re able to walk, would you like to come to my place? It&rsquo;ll give us more space, and we won&rsquo;t disturb the others here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">I nod in response, wordlessly affirming my willingness. With that, he turns and leads the way out of the medical tent.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">The moment I step outside, a wave of chaotic activity greets me. The field is scattered with hundreds of similar tents, some hastily pitched, others already worn from long use. </span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Armoured soldiers rush past, many of them carrying the wounded. Medics dart between tents, shouting instructions, hauling supplies, and tending to the injured. The air is thick with urgency, pain, and resolve.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">But what draws my eyes the most is not the flurry of motion&mdash;it&rsquo;s the wall.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">A colossal structure of white stone looms in the distance, stretching far beyond the edges of my vision. It climbs impossibly high into the sky, and spans the horizon in both directions with no visible end.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">Cyrus notices my stunned gaze and speaks without prompting.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;That wall was built by our ancestors,&rdquo; he said, pride in his voice. &ldquo;A fortress to keep our people safe. A sanctuary in the chaos. Impressive, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;It is&hellip;&rdquo; I murmured, still in awe. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine how many lives were spent building it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;An immeasurable number,&rdquo; he replied solemnly. &ldquo;Peace is made with blood and sweat.&rdquo;</span></p>"
